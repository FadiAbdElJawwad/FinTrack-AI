# AGENTS.md — FinTrack AI

Portfolio-grade Flutter finance tracker. Quality metric = architectural clarity, explainable in a job interview.

## Stack
- Flutter + Dart, Clean Architecture, **feature-first**.
- State: Riverpod (`StreamNotifier`, `AsyncNotifier`) + `flutter_hooks` (`HookConsumerWidget`).
- Models: Freezed. Every Freezed class MUST keep the private constructor `const ClassName._();`.
- Routing: GoRouter, isolated in its own layer.
- Backend: Firebase **Spark plan only**.

## Layout
- `lib/core/{constant,error,extension,providers,routing,services,theme,widgets}/`
- `lib/features/<feature>/{domain,data,presentation}/` — features: `auth`, `currency`, `dashboard`, `transactions`, `wallets` (`dashboard` has `presentation/` only).
- `lib/l10n/`, `lib/generated/`

## Dependency rules (hard)
- Domain → nothing. **No `package:flutter/*` imports in domain**, no Firebase imports. Allowed third-party packages in Domain: `freezed_annotation`, `json_annotation` only.
- Data → Domain only. Presentation → Domain (+ DI wiring).
- Firestore types (`DocumentSnapshot`, `Timestamp`) never leave the Data layer; map to domain entities.

## Riverpod rules
- Riverpod is 2.6.1 and has no `ref.mounted`. After an await inside a Notifier, check a `_disposed` flag (set in `ref.onDispose`) before touching `state` or `ref`. Code that does nothing after an await needs no flag. Never access provider internals through `dynamic`.
- Real-time Firestore data → `StreamNotifier`. No `setState`, no `StatefulWidget` for business state.
- Firestore writes rely on the SDK's local cache for immediate UI updates: do not add manual optimistic state to StreamNotifiers. Repositories translate SDK errors into typed exceptions; controllers never wrap errors into strings.

## UI rules
- **Reuse before create:** search `lib/core/widgets/` before creating any widget. If a match exists, extend it.
- No hardcoded `Color(0xFF...)` and no literal spacing or `EdgeInsets` values inside widgets. Use `Theme.of(context)`, `ColorManager` (`lib/core/constant`), and the `app_sizes` and `text_style_extension` extensions (`lib/core/extension`). Literal values are allowed only inside those definition files. The app supports dark mode: never hardcode a color that breaks in the dark theme.
- Network images: always set `cacheWidth` / `cacheHeight`.

## Firebase Spark constraints
- Forbidden: Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, Firebase AI Logic, anything requiring Blaze.
- Substitutes: file storage → Google Drive API; server logic → Google Apps Script HTTP endpoint.
- Daily quota: 50k reads / 20k writes / 20k deletes. Avoid unbounded listeners; always `limit()` queries; no N+1 reads.

## Security
- Secrets are injected only through `--dart-define` or `--dart-define-from-file`. The local `.env` is gitignored: never create, read, print, or edit any `.env*` file except `.env.example`, which is tracked, holds key names only (no values), and may be edited. Never write real values into any tracked file.
- Never read, print, or modify: `google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`, `firebase_options.dart` secrets, any keystore, any file containing API keys or the Apps Script URL.

## Workflow (mandatory loop)
1. Plan first: list files to touch, then wait for approval if >5 files or any Domain contract change. In an unattended session (for example a cloud session) never wait for approval: if the task exceeds the files or Domain contracts named in the prompt, stop and report instead of asking.
2. Use the Dart MCP server when it is available; otherwise use the CLI, for analysis, symbol lookup, tests, pub.
3. After Freezed/Riverpod-generator edits: `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.
4. Finish only when `flutter analyze` reports zero issues and `flutter test` passes.

## Forbidden without explicit approval
- Adding/removing/upgrading packages in `pubspec.yaml`.
- Editing files outside the scope stated in the task prompt.
- `git push` to any branch other than the current cloud session branch, `firebase deploy`, deleting files.

## Git
- Local agents (agy, OpenCode): run no git command that changes state (commit, restore, checkout, reset, push).
- Cloud sessions: may commit and push to the session branch and open a PR; never merge and never push to main.
- Never use `git update-index` (`--assume-unchanged`, `--skip-worktree`): it hides defects from clean-clone verification.

## Quality
- Never edit a test expectation to make a test pass: report the failing test with the exact error.
- Never sum income and expense into one number (for example a per-category total): separate by `TransactionType`.

## Output
- Summary: files changed + why, analyzer result, test result, open risks.
